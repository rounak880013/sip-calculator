    <h2>SIP Calculator - Calculate Your SIP Returns</h2>
    <p>
      Calculate your SIP returns with our advanced SIP calculator. A SIP, or Systematic Investment Plan, allows you to invest a fixed amount regularly in a mutual fund scheme, helping you build a corpus over time. Our SIP calculator helps you estimate the future value of your SIP investments based on the amount invested, the expected return rate, and the investment duration.
    </p>
    <h3>How SIP Returns are Calculated</h3>
    <p>
      The formula to calculate the future value of a SIP is:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    Future Value = P × [ (1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1 ] × (1 + r/n) / (r/n)
    </code></pre>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>P</strong> is the amount you invest at regular intervals</li>
      <li><strong>r</strong> is the annual interest rate</li>
      <li><strong>n</strong> is the number of compounding periods per year</li>
      <li><strong>t</strong> is the number of years</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Use our SIP calculator to plan your investments effectively and achieve your financial goals.
