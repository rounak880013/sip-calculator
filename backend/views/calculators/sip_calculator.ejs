  <h3>How SIP Returns are Calculated</h3>
  <p>
    The formula to calculate the future value of a SIP is:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
Future Value = P × [ (1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1 ] × (1 + r/n) / (r/n)
  </code></pre>
  <p>Where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>P</strong> is the amount you invest at regular intervals</li>
    <li><strong>r</strong> is the annual interest rate</li>
    <li><strong>n</strong> is the number of compounding periods per year</li>
    <li><strong>t</strong> is the number of years</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This formula takes into account the periodic investments made and the effect of compounding, which helps in accumulating a significant amount over time. Our SIP calculator simplifies this calculation, allowing you to input the necessary values and get instant results.
