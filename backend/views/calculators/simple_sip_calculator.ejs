  <h3>How Simple SIP Returns are Calculated</h3>
  <p>The formula to calculate the future value of a SIP is:</p>
  <pre><code>
  Future Value = P × [ (1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1 ] × (1 + r/n) / (r/n)
  </code></pre>
  <p>Where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>P</strong> is the amount you invest at regular intervals</li>
    <li><strong>r</strong> is the annual interest rate</li>
    <li><strong>n</strong> is the number of compounding periods per year</li>
    <li><strong>t</strong> is the number of years</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This formula takes into account the power of compounding, allowing your investments to grow exponentially over time. By regularly investing a fixed amount, you can benefit from the compounding returns, which can significantly increase the value of your investments.
