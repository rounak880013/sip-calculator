A step-up SIP allows you to increase your investment amount periodically, helping you build a larger corpus over time.

  <h3>How Step-Up SIP Returns are Calculated</h3>
  <p>
    The formula to calculate the future value of a step-up SIP using our Step-Up SIP Calculator is:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
Future Value = P × [(1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1] × (1 + r/n) / (r/n) + (Step-Up Amount × [(1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1] × (1 + r/n) / (r/n))
  </code></pre>
  <p>Where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>P</strong> is the initial amount you invest at regular intervals</li>
    <li><strong>Step-Up Amount</strong> is the amount by which the investment increases periodically</li>
    <li><strong>r</strong> is the annual interest rate</li>
    <li><strong>n</strong> is the number of compounding periods per year</li>
    <li><strong>t</strong> is the number of years</li>
  </ul>
