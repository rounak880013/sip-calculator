    <h2>Step-Up SIP Calculator - Grow Your Investments</h2>
    <p>
      Calculate your step-up SIP returns and grow your investments with our step-up SIP calculator. A step-up SIP allows you to increase your investment amount periodically, helping you build a larger corpus over time. Our calculator helps you estimate the future value of your step-up SIP investments based on the initial amount invested, the periodic increase, the expected return rate, and the investment duration.
    </p>
    <h3>How Step-Up SIP Returns are Calculated</h3>
    <p>
      The formula to calculate the future value of a Step-Up SIP is:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
  Future Value = P × [(1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1] × (1 + r/n) / (r/n) + (Step-Up Amount × [(1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1] × (1 + r/n) / (r/n))
    </code></pre>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>P</strong> is the initial amount you invest at regular intervals</li>
      <li><strong>Step-Up Amount</strong> is the amount by which the investment increases periodically</li>
      <li><strong>r</strong> is the annual interest rate</li>
      <li><strong>n</strong> is the number of compounding periods per year</li>
      <li><strong>t</strong> is the number of years</li>
    </ul>
